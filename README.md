# Geekshop
Geekshop is a ficticious e-commerce application for selling various geeky marchandise online. The main purpose of this demo application is to showcase various features of the Spring Framework 5. This is a monolithic application and it addresses partially the real-world complexities of a e-commerce. An incremental approach has been taken;  each feature branch of repo adressing a certain problemset of the domain.
